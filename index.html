        <h2>About Sea Turtles</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Sea turtles have survived on Earth for more than 100 million years, yet today their future hangs in the balance. Six of the seven sea turtle species are threatened with extinction due to human impacts including fisheries bycatch, coastal development, plastic pollution, and the consumption of sea turtles and their eggs.  </p>
            <p>hrough our sea turtle programs, we aim to fulfill a global need in sea turtle conservation that was previously unmet. We are leading collaborations among hundreds of individuals and institutions worldwide to generate needed information for sea turtle conservation, and we are getting that information into the hands of the people who need it most, from scientists to students, community leaders, governments, and funders. We also support sea turtle conservation efforts on the ground with tools and resources that help them succeed. </p>
            <p>Beyond “just" saving sea turtles, our programs aim to leverage action for broader marine conservation. Because saving sea turtles and saving the oceans require many of the same actions—addressing unsustainable fishing, reducing pollution, mitigating global warming, protecting habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds, maintaining natural coastlines, and developing sustainable local economies. Saving sea turtles is saving the oceans.</p>
